Here to cook some MCPs

This project demonstrates a simple Python function to count the occurrences of a specific letter within a given string. It's a small example to illustrate basic string manipulation. The tool `count_occurence` is exposed via an MCP server.

**Key Features:**

*   A Python function `count_occurence` that takes a string and a letter as input.
*   Calculates and returns the number of times the specified letter appears in the input string.
*   Exposes the tool via an MCP server using `fastmcp`.
