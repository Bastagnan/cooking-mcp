This project demonstrates a simple Python function to count the occurrences of a specific letter within a given string. It's a small example to illustrate basic string manipulation.

**Key Features:**

*   Calculates and returns the number of times the specified letter appears in the input string.

**How to Use:**

1.  Save the code as `simple_operations.py`.
2.  Run the script.
3.  Experiment with different strings and letters to test the function.
